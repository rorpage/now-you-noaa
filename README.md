# Game Over Man

A sports score notifier for home servers. It polls the ESPN API for final scores across multiple sports and leagues, then fires a single webhook notification per game for each team you care about. No score goes unnoticed; no notification repeats.

It is a single Go binary with no runtime dependencies. Drop it on any Linux or macOS machine, point it at a config file, and schedule it with cron or systemd.

## Features

- Tracks teams across NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, AHL, MLS, college football, college basketball, and more
- Follow an entire league during the playoffs with a wildcard `"*"` abbreviation and `postseasonOnly: true`
- One notification per completed game -- no duplicates, even across restarts
- Built-in Slack and Discord payload presets; custom Go template support for any other platform
- Webhook URL configurable via environment variable or config file
- Custom HTTP headers supported (for auth tokens and other per-platform requirements)
- Persistent state in a plain JSON file; old entries are pruned automatically
- Single static binary, no runtime dependencies, no Docker required

Requires Go 1.22+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rorpage/game-over-man.git
cd game-over-man
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o game-over-man .
sudo mv game-over-man /usr/local/bin/
```

## Configuration

Create a config file at `/etc/game-over-man/config.json`:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/game-over-man
sudo nano /etc/game-over-man/config.json
```

```json
{
  "teams": [
    { "sport": "hockey",     "league": "nhl", "abbreviation": "CHI" },
    { "sport": "football",   "league": "nfl", "abbreviation": "IND" },
    { "sport": "basketball", "league": "nba", "abbreviation": "IND" }
  ]
}
```

See `config.example.json` for a more complete example with all supported fields.

### Config fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `teams` | Yes | -- | Array of teams to track |
| `teams[].sport` | Yes | -- | Sport category (e.g. `hockey`, `football`) |
| `teams[].league` | Yes | -- | League identifier (e.g. `nhl`, `nfl`) |
| `teams[].abbreviation` | Yes | -- | Team abbreviation as used by ESPN (e.g. `CHI`, `IND`), or `"*"` to match every team in the league |
| `teams[].postseasonOnly` | No | `false` | When `true`, skip games that are not part of the postseason/playoffs |
| `notificationUrl` | See note | -- | Webhook URL to POST alerts to |
| `notificationMethod` | No | `POST` | HTTP method for notifications |
| `notificationHeaders` | No | -- | Extra headers (e.g. `{"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}`) |
| `notificationType` | No | `webhook` | Payload format: `webhook`, `slack`, `discord`, or `template` |
| `notificationTemplate` | If `template` | -- | Go template string used when `notificationType` is `template` |

The ESPN API may support additional leagues. Test any `sport`/`league` pair with:

```bash
curl "http://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/{league}/scoreboard"
```

## Notification Payload

Each alert is an HTTP POST with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "game": {
    "id": "401589012",
    "sport": "hockey",
    "league": "nhl",
    "date": "2026-05-20T02:00:00Z",
    "homeTeam": { "name": "Chicago Blackhawks", "abbreviation": "CHI", "score": 4, "isHome": true },
    "awayTeam": { "name": "Colorado Avalanche", "abbreviation": "COL", "score": 3, "isHome": false },
    "statusDescription": "Final/OT",
    "isPostseason": true
  },
  "summary": "Final: Chicago Blackhawks 4, Colorado Avalanche 3 (Final/OT)",
  "winner": "Chicago Blackhawks",
  "loser": "Colorado Avalanche",
  "isDraw": false
}
```

`winner` and `loser` are `null` when the game ends in a draw.

### ntfy.sh

Point `notificationUrl` at your topic URL (e.g. `https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts`). The full JSON payload will be the body. To show just the `summary` as a plain-text push notification, use ntfy's [message templating](https://docs.ntfy.sh) or run a small proxy.

### Notification types

The `notificationType` field controls the outgoing payload shape:

| Type | Payload sent |
|---|---|
| `webhook` (default) | Full JSON object (see [Notification Payload](#notification-payload)) |
| `slack` | `{"text": "<summary>"}` — ready for a Slack incoming webhook URL |
| `discord` | `{"content": "<summary>"}` — ready for a Discord webhook URL |
| `template` | Output of your Go template, rendered against the payload data |

**Slack:**

```json
{
  "notificationUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...",
  "notificationType": "slack"
}
```

**Discord:**

```json
{
  "notificationUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
  "notificationType": "discord"
}
```

**Custom template:**

Set `notificationType` to `"template"` and provide a `notificationTemplate` string. The template is rendered with Go's [`text/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and has access to all payload fields:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{.Summary}}` | Pre-built summary string (e.g. `Final: Utah HC 4, Colorado 3 (OT)`) |
| `{{.Winner}}` | Winner's name, or empty if a draw |
| `{{.Loser}}` | Loser's name, or empty if a draw |
| `{{.IsDraw}}` | `true` if the game ended in a draw |
| `{{.Game.HomeTeam.Name}}` / `{{.Game.AwayTeam.Name}}` | Team names |
| `{{.Game.HomeTeam.Score}}` / `{{.Game.AwayTeam.Score}}` | Final scores |
| `{{.Game.HomeTeam.Abbreviation}}` | Team abbreviation |
| `{{.Game.Sport}}` / `{{.Game.League}}` | Sport and league |
| `{{.Game.StatusDescription}}` | Status string (e.g. `Final`, `Final/OT`) |
| `{{.Game.IsPostseason}}` | `true` if the game is part of the postseason/playoffs |

Example — ntfy.sh with a plain-text title:

```json
{
  "notificationUrl": "https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts",
  "notificationType": "template",
  "notificationTemplate": "{\"topic\": \"my-sports-alerts\", \"message\": \"{{.Summary}}\"}"
}
```

## Scheduling

The binary is a one-shot job: it runs, checks scores, and exits.

### systemd timer (recommended)

systemd timers have proper log capture via `journalctl`, survive reboots cleanly with `Persistent=true`, run as a dedicated non-root user, and are standard on any modern Linux distro. Ready-to-use files are in `deploy/systemd/`.

**Quick install:**

```bash
sudo bash deploy/systemd/install.sh
```

The script downloads the latest binary from GitHub Releases (or builds from source if Go is available), creates a `game-over-man` system user, sets up `/etc/game-over-man/` and `/var/lib/game-over-man/`, and enables the timer. Then:

```bash
# Set your notification URL
sudo nano /etc/game-over-man/env

# Copy your config
sudo cp config.json /etc/game-over-man/config.json
sudo chown root:game-over-man /etc/game-over-man/config.json

# Start
sudo systemctl start game-over-man.timer
```

**Useful commands:**

```bash
systemctl status game-over-man.timer     # next scheduled run
systemctl start game-over-man.service    # run immediately
journalctl -u game-over-man -f           # follow logs
```

**Changing the schedule:** Edit `/etc/systemd/system/game-over-man.timer`, update `OnCalendar`, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart game-over-man.timer
```

Common values:

```ini
OnCalendar=*:0/10    # every 10 minutes (default)
OnCalendar=*:0/5     # every 5 minutes
OnCalendar=hourly    # once per hour
```

### cron

Add a line to your crontab with `crontab -e`:

```cron
*/10 * * * * NOTIFICATION_URL=https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts /usr/local/bin/game-over-man
```

Or if you prefer an env file:

```cron
*/10 * * * * env $(cat /etc/game-over-man/env | xargs) /usr/local/bin/game-over-man
```

Logs go to syslog (`journalctl -t game-over-man` or `/var/log/syslog`).

## How It Works

1. Load config from `CONFIG_FILE` (default: `/etc/game-over-man/config.json`)
2. Load notification state from `STATE_FILE`, pruning entries older than `pruneAfterDays`
3. For each unique sport/league in the team list, fetch today's scoreboard from the ESPN API
4. For each completed game involving a tracked team, check whether a notification was already sent
5. If not, POST the notification payload to the configured URL and record the game ID in state
6. Save state to disk

The state file is the single source of truth for idempotency. As long as it persists across runs, no game will ever trigger more than one notification.

## Versioning

Releases are created automatically on every push to `main`. The version follows CalVer: `YYYY.MM.DD.N` where N is the GitHub Actions run number (e.g. `2026.06.13.4`). No manual tagging required.

The version is embedded in the binary at build time:

```bash
game-over-man --version
# 2026.06.13.4
```

When running locally from source, `--version` prints `dev`.

The latest release is always available at `https://github.com/rorpage/game-over-man/releases/latest`.
