# Game Over Man

A containerized sports score notifier. It polls the ESPN API for final scores across multiple sports and leagues, then fires a single webhook notification per game for each team you care about. No score goes unnoticed; no notification repeats.

## Features

- Tracks teams across NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, AHL, MLS, college football, college basketball, and more
- One notification per completed game -- no duplicates, even across container restarts
- Webhook URL configurable via environment variable or config file
- Custom HTTP headers supported (for auth tokens, Slack/Discord format requirements, etc.)
- Persistent state via a mounted volume; old entries are pruned automatically
- Tiny Alpine-based image with no runtime npm dependencies

## Supported Leagues

| Sport | League | `sport` value | `league` value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Football | NFL | `football` | `nfl` |
| Football | College Football | `football` | `college-football` |

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` (which is gitignored) and edit it:

```json
{
  "teams": [
    { "sport": "hockey",   "league": "nhl", "abbreviation": "UTA" },
    { "sport": "hockey",   "league": "ahl", "abbreviation": "TUC" },
    { "sport": "football", "league": "nfl", "abbreviation": "KC"  }
  ],
  "notificationUrl": "https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts",
  "stateFilePath": "/data/state.json",
  "pruneAfterDays": 30
}
```

### Config fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `teams` | Yes | -- | Array of teams to track |
| `teams[].sport` | Yes | -- | Sport category (e.g. `hockey`, `football`) |
| `teams[].league` | Yes | -- | League identifier (e.g. `nhl`, `nfl`) |
| `teams[].abbreviation` | Yes | -- | Team abbreviation as used by ESPN (e.g. `UTA`, `KC`) |
| `notificationUrl` | See note | -- | Webhook URL to POST alerts to |
| `notificationMethod` | No | `POST` | HTTP method for notifications |
| `notificationHeaders` | No | -- | Extra headers to include (e.g. `Authorization`) |
| `stateFilePath` | No | `/data/state.json` | Where to persist notification state |
| `pruneAfterDays` | No | `30` | How many days to keep state entries before pruning |

**Notification URL note:** Set via the `NOTIFICATION_URL` environment variable (preferred, keeps it out of the config file) or directly in the config as `notificationUrl`. The env var takes precedence.

## Notification Payload

Each notification is an HTTP POST with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "game": {
    "id": "401589012",
    "sport": "hockey",
    "league": "nhl",
    "date": "2025-04-10T02:00:00Z",
    "homeTeam": { "name": "Utah Hockey Club", "abbreviation": "UTA", "score": 4, "isHome": true },
    "awayTeam": { "name": "Colorado Avalanche", "abbreviation": "COL", "score": 3, "isHome": false },
    "statusDescription": "Final/OT"
  },
  "summary": "Final: Utah Hockey Club 4, Colorado Avalanche 3 (Final/OT)",
  "winner": "Utah Hockey Club",
  "loser": "Colorado Avalanche",
  "isDraw": false
}
```

### ntfy.sh

For [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh), you can point `notificationUrl` directly at your topic URL. The notification body will be the full JSON payload; use ntfy's click/action features or a small proxy to reformat the `summary` field as plain text if needed.

### Discord

Use a Discord webhook URL as `notificationUrl` and add a `notificationHeaders` entry. Discord expects `content` as the message field; a lightweight proxy or a tool like [n8n](https://n8n.io/) works well for reshaping the payload.

## Running with Docker

The container is a one-shot job: it runs, checks scores, and exits. You schedule it with whatever tool fits your setup. Three options are covered below, from simplest to most fully-featured.

### One-shot (manual / testing)

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/config.json:/config/config.json:ro \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -e NOTIFICATION_URL=https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts \
  ghcr.io/rorpage/game-over-man:latest
```

---

### Option 1: cron

The quickest setup. Add a line to your crontab with `crontab -e`:

```cron
*/10 * * * * docker run --rm -v /etc/game-over-man/config.json:/config/config.json:ro -v /var/lib/game-over-man:/data -e NOTIFICATION_URL=https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts ghcr.io/rorpage/game-over-man:latest
```

Logs go to syslog (`/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl -t CRON`). Simple, but harder to debug than the systemd option.

---

### Option 2: systemd timer (recommended for Linux servers)

systemd timers have proper log capture via `journalctl`, survive reboots cleanly with `Persistent=true`, and are standard on any modern Linux distro. Ready-to-use unit files are in `deploy/systemd/`.

**Quick install:**

```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/game-over-man.service deploy/systemd/game-over-man.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mkdir -p /etc/game-over-man /var/lib/game-over-man
sudo cp deploy/systemd/env.example /etc/game-over-man/env
sudo cp config.json /etc/game-over-man/config.json
```

Edit `/etc/game-over-man/env` with your `NOTIFICATION_URL`, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now game-over-man.timer
```

Or use the included install script, which does all of the above:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/systemd/install.sh
```

**Useful commands:**

```bash
systemctl status game-over-man.timer      # next scheduled run
systemctl start game-over-man.service     # run immediately
journalctl -u game-over-man -f            # follow logs
```

**Changing the schedule:**

Edit `/etc/systemd/system/game-over-man.timer` and update `OnCalendar`. Examples:

```ini
OnCalendar=*:0/10        # every 10 minutes (default)
OnCalendar=*:0/5         # every 5 minutes
OnCalendar=hourly        # once per hour
```

Then `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart game-over-man.timer`.

---

### Option 3: Docker Compose + ofelia

[ofelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia) is a lightweight job scheduler for Docker that runs containers on a cron-style schedule. Use this if you prefer managing everything through Compose.

Copy the files from `deploy/compose/` and edit `ofelia.ini` with your paths and notification URL:

```bash
cp deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml deploy/compose/ofelia.ini ./
```

**ofelia.ini** (edit before running):

```ini
[job-run "game-over-man"]
schedule    = @every 10m
image       = ghcr.io/rorpage/game-over-man:latest
volume      = /etc/game-over-man/config.json:/config/config.json:ro
volume      = /var/lib/game-over-man:/data
environment = NOTIFICATION_URL=https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts
delete      = true
network     = none
```

Start ofelia:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Logs: `docker compose logs -f ofelia`

---

### Kubernetes CronJob

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: game-over-man
spec:
  schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          containers:
            - name: game-over-man
              image: ghcr.io/rorpage/game-over-man:latest
              env:
                - name: NOTIFICATION_URL
                  valueFrom:
                    secretKeyRef:
                      name: game-over-man
                      key: notificationUrl
              volumeMounts:
                - name: config
                  mountPath: /config
                  readOnly: true
                - name: state
                  mountPath: /data
          volumes:
            - name: config
              configMap:
                name: game-over-man-config
            - name: state
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: game-over-man-state
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `NOTIFICATION_URL` | Webhook URL (overrides `notificationUrl` in config) |
| `CONFIG_FILE` | Path to config file (default: `/config/config.json`) |
| `STATE_FILE` | Path to state file (default: `/data/state.json`) |

## Building Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t game-over-man .
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/config.json:/config/config.json:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  -e NOTIFICATION_URL=https://ntfy.sh/my-sports-alerts \
  game-over-man
```

## How It Works

1. Load config from `/config/config.json` (or `CONFIG_FILE`)
2. Load notification state from `/data/state.json` (or `STATE_FILE`), pruning old entries
3. For each unique sport/league in the team list, fetch today's scoreboard from the ESPN API
4. For each completed game involving a tracked team, check whether a notification was already sent
5. If not, POST the notification payload to the configured URL and record the game ID in state
6. Save updated state to disk

The state file is the single source of truth for idempotency. Mounting `/data` as a persistent volume ensures notifications survive container restarts.

## Publishing a New Version

Push to `main` or create a version tag to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow:

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

The image will be published to `ghcr.io/rorpage/game-over-man` with `latest`, the branch name, and the tag.
